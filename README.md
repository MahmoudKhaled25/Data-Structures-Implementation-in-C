# Data Structures Implementation in C

This repository provides a collection of common data structures implemented in the C programming language. It serves as a valuable resource for developers seeking ready-to-use implementations of various data structures.

### Why Use This Repository?

1. **Ready-to-Use Implementations**: The repository offers ready-to-use implementations of essential data structures such as singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, circular singly linked lists, dynamic queues, dynamic stacks, and static stacks. You can simply copy the required files into your project and start using the data structures immediately.
2. **Clear and Well-Structured Code**: Each data structure is implemented as a separate module, making it easy to understand and integrate into your existing codebase. The code is designed to be readable, maintainable, and efficient, following best practices for data structure implementations.
3. **Versatile Usage**: Whether you are learning data structures, practicing coding exercises, or building real-world applications, this repository provides a range of data structures that can be adapted to suit your specific needs. You can use them as standalone data structures or combine them to solve complex problems.
4. **Educational Resource**: The code in this repository can serve as a valuable educational resource for understanding the inner workings of different data structures. By exploring the implementations and studying the code, you can deepen your knowledge of data structures and improve your programming skills.

### Contents and Usage

The repository contains the following data structures:

- Singly Linked List: A linear data structure where each element (node) contains a value and a reference to the next node.
- Doubly Linked List: Similar to a singly linked list, but each node has references to both the next and previous nodes.
- Circular Singly Linked List: A variation of a singly linked list, where the last node points back to the first node, forming a circular structure.
- Dynamic Queue (Array-based): A queue data structure implemented using an array, allowing for dynamic resizing as elements are enqueued and dequeued.
- Dynamic Stack (Array-based): A stack data structure implemented using an array, with dynamic resizing capability to accommodate push and pop operations.
- Static Stack (Array-based): A stack data structure implemented using a fixed-size array, suitable for scenarios where the maximum number of elements is known in advance.

To use any of these data structures in your C projects, follow these steps:

1. Copy the corresponding header and source files for the desired data structure into your project directory.
2. Include the data structure's header file in your source file(s) where you want to use it.
3. Compile and link the data structure's source file along with your other source files.
